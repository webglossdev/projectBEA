"""`bea --doctor`: find out what is broken, and what to type to fix it.

The wizard runs once. Everything it set up can stop working afterwards — a key
expires, an audio device is unplugged, OBS is not open, a model is renamed by
its provider, someone edits the operating manual and removes the one line that
tells her how to speak. Until now the only thing between that and giving up was
a log file.

So: a fixed sequence of checks, each one small enough to name a single cause,
run in the order the pieces depend on each other and **stopped at the first
blocking failure**. There is no point testing the voice when there is no config
file, and a page of red is a page nobody reads. Every failure carries the exact
thing to do about it.

Checks are ordinary async functions returning a `Finding`, and they take the
config rather than a running brain: what breaks in the field is the machine and
its services, not the wiring — CI already assembles the brain on every push.
That is also what makes every one of them testable without a sound card, a key
or a network.
