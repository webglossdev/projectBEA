"""The parts of her that are javascript, and how to get them installed.

There are two, and for a long time only one of them was ever installed. The
dashboard is the obvious one — you notice a missing dashboard immediately. Her
discord voice is a node program too, and nothing said so: the installer built
the dashboard, the updater rebuilt the dashboard, and the discord toggle in the
UI turned on a bot whose packages had never been fetched. It went on looking
enabled and simply never came online.

Listed in one place so that anything which installs, updates or checks her
covers all of it — and so adding a third is one line rather than three.
