"""The update itself: what it checks, in what order, and what it refuses to do.

Two commitments shape everything below.

**Nothing the user wrote is ever lost.** Their prompts are read, backed up and
put back through a three-way merge; anything else of theirs that git tracks and
they have modified stops the run instead of being merged behind their back. The
update is fast-forward only, so a diverged checkout is reported rather than
rewritten. Every run is journalled, so one that dies halfway is undone by the
next one.

**Nothing happens halfway without saying so.** The git half and the rebuild half
can fail independently — a fetch can die on the network, `npm` can be missing
entirely — and rolling a successful fast-forward back because the dashboard did
not rebuild would trade a small problem for a large one. So each step reports
itself, and the report says plainly which ones ran.

The steps are a fixed sequence, named once here, because the terminal and the
dashboard both draw their progress from it.
