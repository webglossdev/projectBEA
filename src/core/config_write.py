"""The dashboard's one save, validated.

`POST /config` used to walk the payload with `hasattr` and `setattr`. `hasattr`
answers for methods and class attributes too, not only for settings: the
endpoint could replace `save_to_file` with an integer, or empty `SECRET_KEYS`
and have the very next save write every API key into config.json in clear text.
Nothing checked types either, so an OBS port could be stored as the word
"banana" and only fail much later, somewhere else.

What may be written is derived rather than guessed. A key has to be a field of
`BrainConfig`, and its value has to fit either the type that field declares or,
where `settings_schema` describes it, the stricter rule declared there. The
whole payload is checked before any of it is applied, so a rejected save leaves
the running config exactly as it was.
