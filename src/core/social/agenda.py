"""Things Bea means to do later, and the pass that makes her do them.

Without this she can only act inside the turn she is already in: the moment a
conversation ends, the thought ends with it. "I'll ask you tomorrow how it
went" was a thing she could say and never a thing she could do.

An intention is deliberately thin — a note and a time. What to actually say is
decided when the moment comes, with the conversation in front of her, not
frozen into a canned line hours earlier.
