"""What the updater must never do to somebody's install.

Every test here runs against real git repositories built in a temp directory —
a bare "origin" and a clone of it — because the whole feature is an argument
about what git does when two people change the same file, and a mocked git
would only ever confirm what we already believe.

The shape of the suite follows the shape of the problem. A file being updated
is in one of four states, and three of them are trivial:

    |                  | upstream unchanged | upstream changed |
    | user untouched   | nothing to do      | git updates it   |
    | user edited      | keep theirs        | ← the real work  |

The last cell is where a naive updater silently destroys either the character
someone wrote or the engine improvements they were owed, so most of what
follows is about that one cell, and about what happens when the user ignores
the result and updates again.
