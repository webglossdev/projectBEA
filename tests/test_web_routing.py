"""The shape of the API, now that it is assembled from routers.

`app.py` was one file with sixty endpoints in it. Splitting it up cannot change
what the API serves, and the one thing that can go wrong when it is assembled
from parts is order: a route registered earlier answers for a URL that belongs
to a later one, and the endpoint simply stops existing with nothing raised
anywhere. These pin both — the full set of paths, and that nothing is shadowed.
