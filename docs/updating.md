## Why `git pull` is not the update command

Six files under `data/prompts/` are tracked by git *and* meant to be edited by
the person running the engine:

| File | Read by | What an edit means |
|---|---|---|
| `soul.md` | every context, via `persona_store` | prose the user wrote; the character |
| `operating.md` | `src/core/mind/operating.py` | the speak tool, moods, how perception is phrased |
| `chat.md` | fallback when the operating manual is absent | legacy system prompt |
| `monologue.md` | the monologue skill | what she says into silence |
| `minecraft.md`, `minecraft_body.md` | the Minecraft agent | goal reasoning and the body loop |

`soul.md` is content and `operating.md` is machinery, but both ship with the
repository and both keep changing upstream. That combination is what breaks a
plain pull: git either refuses the merge, or writes `<<<<<<<` conflict markers
into a file that `src/utils/prompts.py:load_text` will read verbatim into a
system prompt on the next turn. The second outcome is silent — she simply starts
behaving strangely.

Everything else a user owns is already outside git: `.env`, `config.json`,
`data/bea.db`, `data/conversations/`, `data/models/`, `data/clips/` are all
ignored, and `BrainConfig.load_from_file` deep-merges `config.json` over the
dataclass defaults, so settings added upstream appear without migration. The
updater exists for the prompts, and for the rebuild steps a pull leaves undone.

---

## The state a file can be in

```
                 │ upstream unchanged │ upstream changed
 ────────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────
  user untouched │ nothing to do      │ git updates it
  user edited    │ keep theirs        │ three-way merge
```

The bottom-right cell is the whole feature. Both naive answers are wrong: taking
upstream discards the character someone wrote, keeping the local copy freezes
`operating.md` at whatever it was the first time it was touched, so the engine's
own instructions stop improving while the engine does not.

`src/core/update/reconcile.py` runs `git merge-file` per file with three inputs —
the user's version, the version it was based on, the new version — and produces
one of five outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning | Base advances |
|---|---|---|
| `untouched` | the local edit is byte-identical to the new version | yes |
| `kept` | upstream did not change this file | yes |
| `merged` | both sides changed, disjoint regions, combined | yes |
| `conflict` | both sides changed overlapping lines | **no** |
| `removed` | upstream deleted the file; the local copy stands | no |

### The conflict rule

On `conflict` the user's file is written back byte-for-byte and the new version
is written beside it as `<name>.new`. Conflict markers are never written into a
prompt — a marker in `soul.md` is not a merge to resolve later, it is a system
prompt containing garbage.

`.new` is tool-owned: regenerated on every update, overwritten rather than
accumulated, deleted the moment the file stops conflicting or a decision is
recorded. It is always reproducible with `git show HEAD:<path>`, so nothing is
lost by replacing it.

---

## The base map

A three-way merge needs a base, and the base is **not** `HEAD`. If an update
conflicts and nobody resolves it, that file is still built on the revision from
before that update. Merging the next update from the new `HEAD` would present
the changes the user never took as deletions the user made, and drop them for
good — the second time, silently.

Git cannot supply this: to git the file is simply modified. So it is recorded in
`data/.prompt_base.json` (untracked):

```json
{ "format": 1, "bases": { "data/prompts/operating.md": "a1b2c3…" } }
```

Rules, in `runner._base_for` and `reconcile`:

* recorded → use it
* no record, no `.new` beside the file → the pre-merge `HEAD`. A checkout nobody
  has updated holds files that came out of the commit it sits on, so that commit
  *is* the base. Without this, the first update of every install would conflict.
* no record, `.new` present → refuse to merge. A pending conflict is on disk, we
  do not know what it was based on, and guessing `HEAD` is the data loss above.
* on conflict the base is rewritten unchanged, not omitted — an absent entry
  would later be read as "based on whatever `HEAD` is now".

The base also advances on an explicit resolution, which is the only place a
human decides instead of the merge. Without that endpoint, someone who
reconciles by hand leaves no trace, and the next update replays changes their
file already contains.

## The run

`src/core/update/runner.py:apply`. Seven steps, named once in `STEPS` and
rendered by both the terminal and the dashboard.

| Step | Does | Refuses when |
|---|---|---|
| `preflight` | recovers an interrupted run, classifies local changes | not a git checkout, no `origin`, detached HEAD, Docker, git missing, **any modified tracked file outside `data/prompts/` — except the generated lockfiles and the legacy whitelist, which are handled, not refused** |
| `download` | `fetch` (un-shallowing a `--depth 1` clone first), resolves the target | the target is not a descendant of `HEAD` — a diverged checkout is reported, never rewritten |
| `backup` | snapshots edited prompts, `config.json`, `.env` and the database; opens the journal | — |
| `apply` | re-reads the prompts, `checkout HEAD -- data/prompts`, `merge --ff-only` | a prompt changed between the first read and this one |
| `reconcile` | three-way merge per file, writes the base map, closes the journal | — |
| `dependencies` | `uv sync`, when `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` changed | `uv` not on PATH — reported, run continues |
| `dashboard`, `discord bot` | `npm ci` (+ `npm run build` for the dashboard), when that project changed | `npm` not on PATH — reported, run continues |

The target is the tracking branch (`@{u}`), falling back to `origin/main`. The
merge is `--ff-only`: there is no scenario in which the updater creates a merge
commit in somebody's install.

The last two steps can fail without failing the run. Rolling back a successful
fast-forward because `npm` is missing would trade a small problem for a large
one, so the report says which steps ran and the exit code is non-zero.
`src/web/frontend/dist/` is gitignored, so **skipping the rebuild leaves the old
dashboard on screen** — that is why a missing `npm` is reported loudly rather
than ignored.

### Refusals

Local modifications to tracked files outside `data/prompts/` abort the run with
the list. The updater merges prose, not source: if someone has patched the
engine, that is their patch to reconcile.

Two paths are handled instead of refused:

* **The lockfiles** (`src/web/frontend/package-lock.json`,
  `src/core/skills/voice/bot/package-lock.json`). `npm install` rewrites a
  lockfile on its own — a newer compatible version under a `^` range, a
  different npm version, or platform-specific optional deps — so a dirty
  lockfile after a plain install is the normal case. The updater takes the new
  upstream copy, always, and rebuilds with `npm ci`, which installs exactly
  what the lockfile says and never rewrites it. A rebuild therefore leaves no
  local changes behind for the next update to trip over.
* **The legacy whitelist** (`src/core/skills/voice/bot/whitelist.json`). The
  discord bot used to write it into the source tree, so every `!wl add` read as
  local changes. It is stashed before the fast-forward and migrated to the
  untracked `data/discord_whitelist.json` after it — kept, not discarded. When
  the run bails out before merging, it is put back where it was.

### Interruption

`data/.update.journal.json` records the phase before it starts and is deleted on
success. Only `reset`, `merge` and `reconcile` leave the working copy holding
something the user did not write; finding a journal in one of those phases makes
the next run restore the snapshot before doing anything else. A crash anywhere
else left the files alone and only the journal is cleared.

### Concurrency

`data/.update.lock` is created with `O_EXCL`, carries the pid and the source
(`cli` / `dashboard`), and expires by age after 45 minutes. Liveness is
deliberately not checked: `os.kill(pid, 0)` does not probe on Windows, it
terminates.

Two narrower races are handled in the run itself:

* **A prompt saved mid-update.** The dashboard can write `soul.md` at any moment,
  including between the updater reading it and handing the path to
  `git checkout`. The contents are re-read immediately before the reset and the
  run aborts if anything drifted.
* **A torn read.** `persona_store.SoulFile.write` and every write the updater
  makes go through `src/utils/files.py:atomic_write_text` (temp file in the same
  directory, `os.replace`), so a reader sees the old file or the new one, never
  a truncated one.

A check that runs while the lock is held skips the fetch rather than reading
refs another process is rewriting.

## Entry points

```bash
make update                     # uv run bea --update
uv run bea --update --no-rebuild   # git half only
```

`--update` is dispatched in `src/cli.py:run` before the engine is imported, for
the same reason `--setup` and `--doctor` are: it exists to repair the tree
everything else is imported from.

### HTTP

All under `src/web/routers/updates.py`, mounted before the SPA catch-all.

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /update?force=` | availability, `can_apply`, pending reviews, the live run. Cached 30 min server-side |
| `POST /update/check` | forces a fetch |
| `POST /update/apply` | 202; runs on a worker thread. 409 when one is in flight, 403 when disabled |
| `GET /update/run` | step-by-step progress, then the finished report |
| `GET /update/reviews` | files carrying a `.new` |
| `GET /update/reviews/{name}` | both versions, for the diff view |
| `POST /update/reviews/{name}` | `{"choice": "mine" \| "theirs"}` — advances the base, clears the `.new`, reloads the config |

`{name}` is matched against the list of files the updater itself flagged; a name
from the browser is never joined onto a path. The run is threaded because it
blocks on git, uv and npm for minutes, and the event loop is also drawing the
progress bar for that run.

`POST /update/apply` executes code. It is loopback-only like the rest of the
API, it refuses to touch anything modified outside `data/prompts/`, and it can
be switched off entirely:

```json
"updates": { "check": true, "allow_web_apply": true }
```

`check` is the only part that reaches the network, and only to the remote the
copy was cloned from. `allow_web_apply` closes the dashboard door without
affecting `make update`.

## Files on disk

| Path | Lifetime |
|---|---|
| `data/.prompt_base.json` | permanent; losing it costs one manual reconciliation |
| `data/discord_whitelist.json` | permanent; the discord whitelist, untracked so it never blocks an update |
| `data/prompts/*.new` | until the conflict is settled |
| `data/.backups/<utc-stamp>/` | last 8 runs; carries `manifest.json` with the base sha |
| `data/.update.lock` | duration of a run, or 45 minutes |
| `data/.update.journal.json` | duration of a run |

The database is copied with the SQLite backup API rather than `cp`: the engine
holds it open in WAL mode, so the file on disk is missing whatever is still in
the log.

---

## Without git

Nothing in the engine shells out to git. `src/core/update/gitrepo.py` is the
only module that runs it, so on a machine without git she starts, thinks,
speaks, remembers and serves the dashboard exactly as she does anywhere else —
the suite proves it: ~1490 pass, and the ones that skip are the updater's own,
which build real repositories to test against.

What is lost is updating in place. `runner.supported()` returns the reason,
`GET /update` reports `supported: false` with it, the Maintenance screen
explains instead of going blank, and `bea --doctor`'s **Updates** check says so
non-blockingly with the install command for the platform.

git is not installed for the user by anything here. Every package manager that
could do it wants root, there is no portable way to do it across macOS, Linux
and Windows, and `install.sh` is a script people pipe from `curl` — one that
silently escalates to `sudo` is not one worth trusting. The installers refuse
with the exact command instead.

---

## What it does not do

* **Restart her.** The new code is on disk; the running process keeps the old
  one until someone restarts it. A self-`exec` from inside the request that
  triggered it races the memory flush in `cli.main`'s `finally` block, which is
  worse than a banner saying "restart to finish".
* **Merge anything outside `data/prompts/`.**
* **Rewrite history, stash, or create merge commits.** `git stash pop` writes
  conflict markers on collision, which is the one outcome forbidden here.
* **Work in Docker.** The source tree is the image; the update is
  `docker compose build`.

---

## Version

`src/core/update/version.py` reads the installed package metadata, falling back
to `pyproject.toml`. It is the single source of truth: `GET /status` carries it
and the dashboard renders what it is told. The dashboard used to hardcode its
own string, which disagreed with `pyproject.toml` — two version numbers is the
same as none, and an update check has nothing to compare against.
