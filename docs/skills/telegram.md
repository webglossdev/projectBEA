## What it does

Bea reads and answers Telegram — private chats and groups — as one more place
where she has conversations. It runs **in-process**: Telegram voice notes are
downloaded, transcribed by the configured Groq or local Whisper backend, and
then enter the same conversation path as text.

```
src/core/skills/telegram/
├── surface.py    TelegramSkill — lifecycle, senses, message tools
└── handlers.py   pure extraction: is_bot_called, message_text, display_name…
```

`TelegramSkill` extends [`PlatformSkill`](overview.md#two-shapes-of-skill). All
it owes is `platform = "telegram"`, an `Author` builder and `send_text` — the
roster, person cards and attention priorities work on top
of that with no Telegram-specific code, because they are keyed on `Author` and
`conversation_key`.

---

## The handlers decide nothing

`handlers.py` is deliberately thin. It extracts the text, works out whether Bea
was called, builds the identity and deposits a perception — then returns. The
attention gate decides whether she reacts; a scoped turn decides what she says.
A handler that reasons is a handler that duplicates the mind.

`is_bot_called()` is pure and tested against a table of cases rather than
against Telegram: `@username` mention, a reply to one of her messages, a trigger
word (fuzzy, whole-word), or a private chat where everything is for her.

## How a message flows

```
telegram update
    └─ _on_message (thin)
          ├─ allowed chat?          allowed_chats, empty = every chat
          ├─ Author(platform="telegram", native_id=<user id>)
          ├─ is_dm / mentions_self / reply_to_self flags
          └─ bus.put(Perception(CHAT, conversation_key="telegram:<chat_id>"))
                  └─ attention gate annotates → the one frame of the one loop
```

Polling runs with `concurrent_updates(True)`: several chats are read at once and
land in the same batch. Bea answers one turn at a time, several chats in
parallel.

Replies go out through the humanizer — one line per message, with a typing pause
between them. Telegram reactions are not used (`supports_reactions = False`).
Voice notes are saved with an `.ogg` suffix before STT; Telegram normally sends
Ogg/Opus bytes, and Groq/OpenAI-compatible transcription rejects the common
`.oga` suffix even when the bytes are valid. Photos are downloaded briefly and
passed as a data URL to multimodal providers; if a download fails, the textual
`[photo]` label is retained instead of dropping the message.

## Tools

| Tool | Where |
|---|---|
| `telegram_send_message(chat_id, text)` | the live loop — writing somewhere unprompted |
| `send_message(platform, channel, text)`, `react`, `say_nothing` | the one loop — answering where it arrived |

Telegram's Bot API does not allow a bot to edit another user's message. Deleting
another member's message requires the bot to be an administrator with **Delete
messages** enabled in the group. Sending and editing Bea's own messages still
requires the relevant chat permissions and an unexpired message.

## Configuration

```json
"telegram": {
  "enabled": false,
  "token": "",
  "owner_id": "",
  "allowed_chats": [],
  "transcribe_voice": true
}
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `token` | Bot token. Lives in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`; typing it in the dashboard writes it there, never into `config.json` |
| `owner_id` | Your Telegram user id; messages from it count as the owner, which bypasses cooldown and quiet hours |
| `allowed_chats` | Chat ids Bea may read. **Empty means every chat she is added to** |
| `transcribe_voice` | Transcribe Telegram voice notes before depositing them; defaults to `true` |

Trigger words come from `attention.trigger_words`, not from this block — they
are the same names everywhere.

---

## Setup

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and copy the token.
2. Put `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` in `.env`.
3. For groups, disable BotFather's privacy mode if you want her to read
   everything rather than only messages that mention her.
4. Toggle the skill on in the dashboard.
5. In groups where Bea should moderate, promote the bot to an administrator and
   grant **Delete messages**. Do not grant more rights than needed.
